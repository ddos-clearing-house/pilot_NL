# Similar Initiatives
This document is intended to list initiative similar (somehow) to our DDoS Clearing House.

## RELATED WORK
**Other (somehow similar) projects, although all are great, none of the projects bellow create/share/use DDoS attack fingerprints for any purpose!**

- https://galois.com/project/3dcop-ddos-defense/
  - "The DDoS Defense for a Community of Peers (3DCoP) uses a unique collaborative model wherein multiple organizations work together to detect DDoS attacks, compute mitigations, and convince service providers to take action. Our solution advances the state of DDoS defense by providing new tools that allow multiple defenders to coordinate their response, resulting in earlier detection and faster DDoS mitigation. Underlying our implementation is a unique traffic flow monitoring capability, which observes traffic flows in and out of the enclave and finds patterns of interest."

- https://www.impactcybertrust.org 
  - "IMPACT supports the global cyber-risk research & development community by coordinating and developing real-world data and information-sharing capabilities between academia, industry and government. It is the only freely-available, legally-collected, distributed repository of large-scale cybersecurity data and analytics tools allowing researchers to advance the state-of-the-art in cyber-risk R&D and decision support."
  
- https://ddosmon.net 
  - "DDoSMon is our <Security Research Lab at Qihoo 360> global DDoS attack monitoring system, it sees on average more than 30k unique DDos attacks every single day. This system is heavily used by lots of regular security engineers from various corporation & organization."

- https://sissden.eu
  - "SISSDEN is a Horizon 2020 project aimed at improving the cybersecurity posture of EU entities and end users through the development of situational awareness and sharing of actionable information. It builds on the experience of The Shadowserver Foundation, a non-profit organization well known in the security community for its efforts in mitigation of botnet and malware propagation, free of charge victim notification services, and close collaboration with Law Enforcement Agencies, national CERTs, and network providers."
